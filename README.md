- Ability to run Linux commands and scripts seamlessly
- Built-in support for network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Netcat)
- System monitoring tools to view and manage running processes
- Hardware-level access where permissible (battery, CPU stats, sensors)
- Secure and stable execution environment with sandboxed sessions
- Root-friendly features (optional) for advanced users
- Plugin/module system for extending functionality
- Better integration with Android storage, permissions, and UI/UX
- Optional GUI elements to assist with common terminal tasks
